# MindCare Security Documentation

## Overview

MindCare implements comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive mental health data and ensure HIPAA compliance where applicable. This document outlines the security architecture, data protection mechanisms, and access controls implemented in the application.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Firebase Authentication
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Email/password with optional MFA
- **Email Verification**: Required for account activation
- **Custom Claims**: Role-based access control (user, therapist, admin)
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Users**: Access to personal data only
- **Therapists**: Access to patient data with consent
- **Admins**: Full system access for moderation and management

### 2. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Sensitive journal entries and personal data
- **Transport Layer Security**: All communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **Database Encryption**: Firebase Firestore native encryption at rest
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and storage

#### Data Classification
- **Highly Sensitive**: Therapy journals, medication logs, session notes
- **Sensitive**: Mood entries, wellness data, personal profiles
- **Internal**: Community posts, learning resources
- **Public**: Crisis resources, general information

### 3. Firestore Security Rules

#### Core Principles
1. **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid authentication
2. **Data Ownership**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access
4. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all data
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of sensitive operations

#### Collection-Specific Rules

##### Personal Data Collections
```javascript
// Therapy journal entries - strictest security
match /therapy_journal/{entryId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(resource);
  // Encryption required for sensitive content
  allow create: if request.resource.data.is_encrypted == true;
}

// Mood entries - personal access only
match /mood_entries/{entryId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(resource);
}
```

##### Healthcare Data
```javascript
// Medication logs - HIPAA-sensitive data
match /medication_logs/{logId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(resource);
}

// Session notes - therapist and patient access
match /session_notes/{noteId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
              (isOwner(resource) || isTherapist());
}
```

##### Community Features
```javascript
// Community posts - moderated public access
match /community_posts/{postId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
                  !request.resource.data.content.matches('.*\\b(spam|inappropriate)\\b.*');
}
```

### 4. Storage Security Rules

#### File Access Control
- **Profile Images**: Public read, owner write
- **Journal Attachments**: Private to owner only
- **Size Limits**: Prevent DoS attacks through large uploads
- **File Type Validation**: Only approved file types allowed

#### Example Storage Rules
```javascript
// Journal attachments - private to user
match /journal_attachments/{userId}/{attachmentId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && 
                        isOwner(userId) && 
                        isValidFile();
}
```

### 5. Data Privacy & Compliance

#### HIPAA Compliance Measures
- **Business Associate Agreement**: With Firebase/Google Cloud
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Right to Delete**: User data deletion capabilities

#### Privacy by Design
- **Anonymization**: Optional anonymous community participation
- **Consent Management**: Granular privacy controls
- **Data Portability**: User data export functionality
- **Privacy Controls**: User-configurable sharing permissions

### 6. Security Monitoring

#### Threat Detection
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual access patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS and injection prevention
- **Content Moderation**: AI-powered content filtering

#### Incident Response
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activity
- **Breach Response**: Documented incident response procedures
- **Data Recovery**: Backup and restoration capabilities
- **User Notification**: Automatic security incident notifications

### 7. Development Security

#### Secure Development Practices
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security audits

#### Environment Security
- **Development/Production Separation**: Isolated environments
- **Secret Management**: Secure API key and secret storage
- **Access Controls**: Limited production access
- **Version Control**: Secure code repository management

### 8. Crisis Intervention Security

#### Emergency Access
- **Crisis Detection**: AI-powered risk assessment
- **Emergency Contacts**: Secure emergency contact system
- **Professional Intervention**: Therapist alert mechanisms
- **Legal Compliance**: Duty to warn procedures

#### Data Handling in Crisis
- **Emergency Access**: Override privacy for safety
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of emergency access
- **Professional Protocols**: Integration with crisis services
- **Legal Documentation**: Compliance with local regulations

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Never Log Sensitive Data**: No PII in application logs
2. **Validate All Inputs**: Server-side validation required
3. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Prevent injection attacks
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
5. **Regular Security Updates**: Keep dependencies current

### For System Administrators

1. **Monitor Access Patterns**: Regular audit log reviews
2. **Update Security Rules**: Regular rule reviews and updates
3. **Backup Encryption**: Ensure backups are encrypted
4. **Access Review**: Regular user access audits
5. **Incident Procedures**: Document and test response procedures

### For Therapists

1. **Professional Boundaries**: Maintain therapeutic relationships
2. **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data access
3. **Secure Communication**: Use encrypted communication channels
